Hi, I'm Jonas, a developer interested in Rust and other modern technologies.

Starting at a young age, I've had a keen interest in physical reverse engineering and DIY-repair.

Systems languages posess a particular charme, there are more complex challenges involved in scaling while maintaining efficient operation.
